            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                The <span class="highlight">Government of NCT of Delhi</span>, through its IT Department, is committed
                to advancing healthcare services by leveraging cutting-edge technology to improve patient care and
                hospital management. Our focus is on creating and implementing technological solutions that address
                critical challenges in the healthcare sector, particularly in MedTech, BioTech, and HealthTech domains.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of our key initiatives is the development of software solutions designed to optimize hospital
                operations. This includes implementing queuing models in outpatient departments (OPDs) to reduce patient
                wait times, improving the management and availability of hospital beds, and streamlining the admission
                process for patients. These solutions are crucial for enhancing the efficiency of healthcare delivery in
                hospitals, ensuring that patients receive timely and effective care.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to patient management, our efforts extend to the study and improvement of inventory
                management for medicines and consumables within hospitals. Efficient inventory management is vital for
                ensuring that essential medicines and supplies are always available, reducing wastage, and lowering
                costs. We are working on developing and integrating these modules at the hospital level, providing
                comprehensive support to healthcare facilities in managing their resources effectively.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <span class="highlight">National Informatics Centre (NIC)</span> has already developed some of these
                modules, and our department is focused on ensuring their successful implementation in Delhi. Our vision
                is to create a hospital-based solution that can be seamlessly integrated with city-wide healthcare
                modules, facilitating a cohesive and connected healthcare ecosystem across the region.
            </p>

            <p>
                By harnessing the power of technology, the IT Department of GNCTD is dedicated to transforming
                healthcare services in Delhi, improving patient outcomes, and setting new standards in hospital
                management. Our mission is to ensure that every citizen has access to the best possible healthcare
                services, supported by innovative and efficient technological solutions.
